# 🚀 My Machine Learning Journey

This repository documents my path to building a **Machine Learning (ML) system** from scratch — from learning the fundamentals, experimenting with small projects, to developing full-fledged ML solutions.  

The goal of this repo is not only to track my progress, but also to serve as a guide for anyone following a similar path.  

---

## 📌 Project Purpose
- Document my step-by-step learning process.  
- Build, train, and deploy machine learning models.  
- Track challenges, failures, and improvements.  
- Create a working ML system as a capstone project.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
I plan to use the following along the way (this list will grow):  

- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- **Experiment Tracking:** Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub versioning  
- **Deployment:** (To be decided — Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit)
